# Kafka Streams

Kafka Streams is a Java library provided by Apache Kafka for building real-time stream processing applications and
microservices. KSQL (now known as ksqlDB) is a streaming SQL engine for Apache Kafka that lets you query and process
Kafka data using SQL-like syntax, without writing code in Java or Scala.
